# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 6 - THE INFILTRATION OF NYX STERLING

![GameScreenshot](Screenshots/screen01.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is [Playdate]

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using the Playdate SDK, which is Lua-based and is one of two ways to build application for the Playdate. Since I don't have a device, I'm doing everything with the simulator.

Since the SDK doesn't have any editor tools, I used Unity to make a sort of level editor. From that level editor (done using some scripts and [OkapiKit] stuff), I can export some files with a custom format (building a tile palette, exporting tilemap and paths, along with enemies) that I can load with Lua code on the other end...

## Game

In this game, the player is Nyx Sterling, a cat-burgler turned freedom fighter. She has to infiltrate the facility where Doctor Ignatius Cogwell is developing MoodMorph, a mind altering drug. We have to prevent him from completing his research and deploy it, further increasing the control Prime Nexus' control over society.

The player can only control Nyx using the crank, to walk forward or back, avoiding being seen by the guards, security cameras, etc.
